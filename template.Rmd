| Abstract | An example write-up of a C&C session |
| Type | Project showcase |
| Level | 0: No experience necessary |

#### Structure 

A session write-up should be a simple R markdown document, use this as a template. Use an H2 heading (`##`) for the session title followed by a `lead-para` block that gives a short synopsis of the session and complete the session details table. Then use H4 headings (`####`) for further section headings in the markdown document. Save it in the sessions directory in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_title.Rmd`

#### What to include

A session write-up should be brief, outlining what proejct/tools demonstrated and what particular features of the project/tools were focussed on. Do not include any sensitive information as these are public domain records.

#### Links

Please try to provide some links:

* at the very least provide links to the R packages/Python libraries used
* if the project or example is in a public repository provide a link to it
* provide links to external examples how the package is used
* or further reading, or people to follow on Twitter
