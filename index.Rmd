This is a microsite and associated public github repo for resources associated with the Cabinet Office analytical community's Coffee & Coding sessions. 
:::

The aim of [Coffee & Coding meetups](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html) is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at an organisation. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within an organisation who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other.

Data science/analytical Coffee & Coding sessions are already established in at least seven departments (BEIS, DfE, DfT, DHSC, MOD, MOJ & ONS) and thereâ€™s an active [#coffee-and-coding channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/messages/CDMCN3Y7J/convo/C0NF51LE4-1558020122.025000/) on the cross-government data science Slack team. 

### When and where
In the Cabinet Office, our Coffee & Coding sessions take place fortnightly on Friday mornings. Details of the specific meetups are provided in event invites sent out through the Cabinet Office analytical community, if you'd like to know more please get in touch via coffee-and-coding@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.
