#### Coffee & Coding 

We discussed the results of our [interest survey](../docs/cnc_setup_survey.html) and people's experiences of C&C in other departments. We agreed to hold C&C sessions on a fortnightly basis, and that Friday was the best option to fit with people's schedules. Wherever possible virtual attendence should be supported so that people in other buildings or who work from home can easily participate.

#### Mapping civil servants
A demonstration of the [civil servants by local authority (2018) map](https://co-analysis.github.io/csmapping/cs_lad_2018.html), which draws down data from the NOMIS API and the ONS Geoportal to create an interactive map in an RMarkdown document using leaflet.
